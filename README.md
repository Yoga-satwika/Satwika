 Repository: 
       Repository means a storage place where all your project files and their change history are saved and managed.
1.1 Understanding what a Git repository is.  
      A Git repository is a version-controlled folder.
      version - controlled folders is a normal folder where Git keeps track of every change you make to the files — like saving all versions so you can go back anytime.
      
   It contains:
      
 Files and folders of your project.
      Commit history (all previous versions of your files).
      Branches (different development lines).
      Types of repositories:
      Local repository – exists on your own computer.
      Remote repository – exists on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to share with others.
